* I created this web using vanilla CSS and HTML.

* I did my best using the correct semantics for the HTML
to have a good SEO.

* I added properly comments for both HTML and CSS.

* Clean code.

* I used Flexbox along the structure of the web to have a good responsive desing.

* Responsive for Large, Medium and Small screen sizes.
